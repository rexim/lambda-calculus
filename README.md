# Morganey [![Status Ventis](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-ventis-yellow.svg)](https://github.com/ForNeVeR/andivionian-status-classifier)

[Lambda Calculus][wiki-lambda-calculus] based programming language
that recognizes Church encoded structures.

## Usage ##

Before doing anything useful with Morganey you need to install
[sbt][scala-sbt] first.

### REPL ###

To run the REPL just enter the following in the source code directory

    $ sbt run

and start entring REPL commands there. You can enter

- `<term>` (see [Language](#language))
- `<binding>` (see [Language](#language))
- `<loading>` (see [Language](#language))
- `:exit` - exits the REPL
- `:raw <term>` - prints the representation of the term
- `:unbind <regex>` - clears either the current context, or all bindings matching the regex

The REPL will take the entered lambda term, beta-reduce it with the
normal order reduction strategy and output the normal form of the
entered lambda term.

To quit the REPL just `^C` it.

### Program Execution ###

To execute a program written in Morganey do the following:

    $ sbt "run main.mgn"

Where `main.mgn` is the name of the file that contains the
program. The program should provide an entry point. An entry point is
a binding with the name `main` which is bound to function of one
argument:

    main := \input . ...

For more information see [Execution Semantic][execution-semantic]

### Unit Tests ###

To run the Unit Tests enter the following in the source code directory

    $ sbt clean coverage test
    $ sbt coverageReport
    $ sbt coverageAggregate

And after that you can take a look at the Unit Test coverage
results. Just open `target/scala-2.11/scoverage-report/index.html`
with your favorite browser.

### Functional Tests ###

    $ sbt funtests

### Build an uberjar ###

To build an uberjar run the following command

    $ sbt assembly

After that find the uberjar at `target/scala-2.11/morganey.jar`

## Language ##

### BNF ###

    <term> ::= <function>
             | <application>
             | <literal>
             | <variable>
             | "(" <term> "," <term> ")"
             | "(" <term> ")"
    <binding> ::= <variable> ":=" <term>
    <loading> ::= "load" <module-path>
    <module-path> := [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9.]*

    <literal> ::= <numeric-literal>
                | <character-literal>
                | <string-literal>
                | <list-literal>
    <numeric-literal> ::= [0-9]+
    <character-literal> ::= '[\u0020-\u00B0]'
                          | '\\[\\'"bfnrt]'
    <string-literal> ::= <java-string-literal>
    <list-literal> ::= "[" [ term { "," term } ] "]"
                     | "[" <term> [ "," <term> ] ".." <term> "]"
    <number-or-character> ::= <numeric-literal>
                            | <character-literal>

    <variable> ::= [a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*
    <function> ::= <lambda-symbol> <variable> "." { <variable> "." } <term>
    <application> ::= <term> <term> { <term> }
    <lambda-symbol> ::= "λ"
                      | "\"

### Comments ###

In Morganey there are two types of comments: single-line (starting
with double slash `//`, extending to the end of the line) and
multi-line comments (any text, surrounded by `/*` and `*/`).
